		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>
			I am a Software Engineer with a passion for application, game, and web development. This is a website I have built for myself that showcases my skills and experience. On my portfolio there is a list of both personal and school projects that I have worked on. Much of my free time is spent working on these, as I hope to set myself apart from my peers. I am familiar with programming languages such as Java, C#, Python, and C. I have worked with Android Studio to build apps and Unity to build video games and am comfortable in both environments.<br>
			Early on I knew that I would only get what I put in. That is, I would have to work hard in order to succeed. As a kid I played lots of video games and spent all of my time on my computer, and so when it came time to choose a career path I knew what direction I wanted to go in. My dream is to be a programmer that helps create applications that will affect millions of people, even if it is in small ways.<br><br>
			Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere. - Carl Sagan <br><br>
