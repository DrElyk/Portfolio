		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>
			I am a Software Developer currently searching for full-time opportunites in Florida. I am attending the University of Central Florida and I expect to graduate in Spring 2019 with a degree in Computer Science. I work as an intern at Siemens when I am not at school, and I hope to utilize this industry experience to set myself apart from my peers. I am proficient with programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript. I also consider myself familiar with tools such as Salesforce, AWS, Git, and Unity. I built this website to showcase some of my projects and work experience.<br><br>
			Feel free to contact me, either by e-mail or by phone.<br>
