		<h3>Software Developer Intern at Siemens</h3>
		<p>
			May 2018 - Present
			<br><br>
			I work as a developer for Siemens' Salesforce Customer Portal team. The Customer Portal provides products, solutions, and services to customers and is designed and maintained using Salesforce. Salesforce is a Customer Relationshop Management (CRM) tool, helping Siemens to manage clients and improve efficiency. We work in Agile sprints lasting two weeks, which begin with clients requesting new functionality for the Portal. Each of these "user stories" are assigned story points by the team and tracked in Jira, an issue tracking product. Once the story goes through the different stages of development in a Sandbox it is marked as 'Done' and demoed to the client before being deployed to the Production environment.
			<br><br>
			I was in charge of creating a new server in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and migrating all of the comapany resources to it. I wrote a script that utilized the AWS Command Line Interface to automate this process. I also wrote bucket policies and modified Java code to ensure that documents could be uploaded automatically to the new server.
			<br><br>
			I also investigated a long standing issue with multiple instances of the same docuement appearing on the Portal. To solve this, I had to search through the tens of thousands of documents and identify which ones were duplicates. I wrote a batch Apex class to query for possible duplicates and mass delete them, thus sanitizing our data.

		<h3>Attractions Attendant at Universal Orlando Resort</h3>
		<p>
			June 2017 - Present
			<br><br>
			On weekends, I work at Doctor Doom's Fearfall located at Universal's Islands of Adventure. My duties include interacting with guests, following safety protocols, and operating the attraction. The most valuable skill I have learned is handling guests. There are many times I have had to de-escalate a guest situation on my own, either by accomodating them to another attraction or reassuring them that I understand their concerns. Starting in May 2018, I became a trainer, in which I welcome new hires to the team and make sure they have the skills necessary to provide excellent guest service.
