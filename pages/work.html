		<h3>Technical Intern at Siemens</h3>
		<p>
			May 2018 - Present<br>
			As an intern, I work on a variety of projects to broaden my skills and knowledge. This ranges from participating in weekly meetings, to working as a System Administrator on Siemen's Salesforce org, and writing code.
			<br>
			I respond to cases to add new users and reactivate liscenses. This involves communicating with clients to determine what issue they are having and working to resolve it.
			<br>
			Using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) I automated the process of transferring company resources to a new Amazon Server. I also wrote Java code to test the process of uploading documents and creating signed URLs.
			<br><br>
			Skills learned:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Salesforce Development</li>
			<li>Apex Programming</li>
			<li>Visualforce framework</li>
			<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Attractions Attendant at Universal Orlando Resort</h3>
		<p>
			June 2017 - Present<br>
			On weekends, I work at Doctor Doom's Fearfall located at Universal's Islands of Adventure. My duties include interacting with guests, following safety protocols, and operating the attraction. The most valuable skill I have learned is handling guests. There are many times I have had to de-escalate a guest situation on my own, either by accomodating them to another attraction or reassuring them that I understand their concerns. Starting in May 2018, I became a trainer, in which I welcome new hires to the team and make sure they have the skills necessary to provide excellent guest service.

		<h3>Associate at Panera Bread</h3>
		<p>
			April 2015 - August 2016<br>
			As my first job, I worked over the summer as an associate at Panera Bread. My duties included making food, cleaning dishes, waiting tables, and ensuring customers had a quality dining experience. At Panera I learned about what was expected of me as an employee and I still apply many of the lessons I learned to this day.
