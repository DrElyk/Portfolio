			I am going into my fourth year studying Computer Science at University of Central Florida. Currently I have a 3.8 GPA and am expecting to graduate in Spring 2019. Early on in my college career, I realized that the best way to succeed was to apply myself as much as I could both in and out of school. Therefore, I started to look for clubs and activities outside of class that could give me an advantage.<br><br>
			Hack@UCF is a cyber security club that holds meetings and workshops that I have attended. Through this club I was able to set up a virtual Linux environment on my laptop, and explore ways to create a more developer friendly environment.<br>
			GameDev Knights is a video game development club that I joined once I realized I had a passion for making games. Through this club I participated in <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/indiegalactic2016" target = "_blank">Indie Galactic Space Jam 2016,</a>an annual game jam in Orlando. I joined a group of 6 people and helped make a 3D golfing game set on the moon. Space Golf can be found in more detail on my portfolio.<br><br>
			Classes that I have completed:
			<ul>
				<li>Processes for Object Oriented Software Development - A class designed to model the entire software development life cycle. We split into groups and then worked together to gather requirements, create documentation, build the project, and create test cases. My group's completed project, Space Shooter, can be viewed on my portfolio.</li>
				<li>Database Design - An introduction to databases. We created Entity Relationship Diagrams, learned how to normalize data, learned basic SQL in conjunction with MySQL, and touched on MongoDB.</li>
				<li>Computer Science 1 and 2 - A class focused on the study of algorithms, run time analysis, and data structures. We touched on topics such as number theory, graph theory, and dynamic programming.</li>
				<li>System Software - Focused mainly on the logic behind compilers, parsers, code generators, etc. We built a project in C that parsed a source program written in PL/0, checked it for sytax, generated assembly code, and then ran it through a virtual machine.</li>
				<li>Security in Computing - An introduction to cyber security concepts. We covered topics such as buffer overflows, phishing attacks, the different types of malware, and password salting.</li>
			</ul>
