		<p>
			I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2019. I finished my classes with 
			a 3.8 GPA. UCF is a great school and I loved my time there, as I frequently went to club meetings such as Hack@UCF and Game Dev Knights.
			One of my most memorable experiences is working with my teammates on our Senior Design project during my last semester. The dedication
			from every member of the team really exemplifies the UCF spirit as we often worked together overtime to perfect our application.
			More details about the project are found on my project list.<br><br>
			Relevant Coursework:
			<ul>
				<li>Processes for Object Oriented Software Development - A class designed to model the entire software development life cycle. We split into groups and then worked together to gather requirements, create documentation, build the project, and create test cases. My group's completed project, Space Shooter, can be viewed on my portfolio.</li>
				<li>Web-Based Information Technology - A class that introduced Web Development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Database Design - An introduction to databases. We created Entity Relationship Diagrams, learned how to normalize data, learned basic SQL in conjunction with MySQL, and touched on MongoDB.</li>
				<li>Computer Science 1 and 2 - A class focused on the study of algorithms, run time analysis, and data structures. We touched on topics such as number theory, graph theory, and dynamic programming.</li>
				<li>System Software - Focused mainly on the logic behind compilers, parsers, code generators, etc. We built a project in C that parsed a source program written in PL/0, checked it for sytax, generated assembly code, and then ran it through a virtual machine.</li>
				<li>Security in Computing - An introduction to cyber security concepts. We covered topics such as buffer overflows, phishing attacks, the different types of malware, and password salting.</li>
				<li>Theory of Computation - Focused on regular expressions, grammars, languages, finite state machines, and logical proofs.</li>
