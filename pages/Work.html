		<h3>Attractions Attendant at Universal Orlando Resort</h3>
		<p>
			June 2017 - Present<br>
			On weekends, I work at Doctor Doom's Fearfall located at Universal's Islands of Adventure. My duties include interacting with guests, following safety protocols, and operating the attraction. The most valuable skill I have learned is handling guests. There are many times I have had to de-escalate a guest situation on my own, either by accomodating them to another attraction or reassuring them that I understand their concerns. Starting in May 2018, I became a trainer, in which I welcome new hires to the team and make sure they have the skills necessary to provide excellent guest service.

		<h3>Associate at Panera Bread</h3>
		<p>
			April 2015 - August 2016<br>
			As my first job, I worked over the summer as an associate at Panera Bread. My duties included making food, cleaning dishes, waiting tables, and ensuring customers had a quality dining experience. At Panera I learned about what was expected of me as an employee and I still apply many of the lessons I learned to this day.
